		<h1> About</h1>
		<div class="text">
			<p> My name is <b> Agbebi Oluwashola Samuel</b>, a <b> Fullstack Developer </b>. This project is inspired by my love for movies, as a movie lover, i would jump on any newly released movie.
			 	Some movies leaves you disappointed in the end or rather a feel of waste of precious time so i came up with this idea to help movie lovers like me save thier time by creating this webiste.
				Users can come in to see which new movie is best rated and also login to share their experience on the movies they have seen through the voting poll page.
				This helps solve issues on which movies to watch or not to waste time on watching.</p>
